Andreas Ciroth,"Owner, GreenDelta","Yes it looks appealing if you work in LCA and carbon footprint (putting the results out to the public and end consumer), but seems also naive. Almost as if saying: if you smoke one cigarette, you will live 12 minutes and 34 seconds less (without referring a specific study, assessment methodology, etc.). And in LCA and CF, you have the specific issue of different background databases with entirely different results for similar supply chains, maybe more than in cigerette-health investigations (but I am not an expert there).

Are those numbers high or low? Are assumptions reasonable? Do they apply to me and my country? How could I impact them? What happens to the use (0.0) if I wash them regularly in my washing machine? Would that make them last longer to an extent that would be worth the extra emissions for doing so? Are the total numbers comparable to total numbers for similar or entirely different products? I'd be the first to welcome more LCA studies but there is a great risk that we get too focused on the existence of such numbers and less what they mean. In this case the key message to consumers would be: This product comes with an amount of embedded carbon emissions. Don't waste it.
